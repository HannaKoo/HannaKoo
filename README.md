In my doctoral dissertation I have focused on Medieval Latin that presents unique challenges for Digital Humanities. 
- I have worked to structure complex and varied edited documents into machine-readable data in TEI-XML, enriched with precise metadata. At the core of my research are the penitentiary documents produced by the Apostolic See in the Vatican, spanning from  14th century to the 16th century representing the non-literary genre.
- Using this and other material for diverse historical and linguistic inquiries is challenging without tools such as lemma-based search options or grammatical tagging.
- This is especially pertinent for highly inflected languages like Latin.
- To address this, I have developed automatic morpho-syntactic parsers based on Universal Dependencies annotation together with other TurkuNLP researchers.
- State-of-the-art parsers, including Stanza, Trankit, and a custom model, have been significantly enhanced by our work in merging training treebanks and implementing a majority-vote approach to combine predictions effectively.
